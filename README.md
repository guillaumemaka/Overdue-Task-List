##OVERDUE ASSIGNMENT

###Objective:

Now that you have learned about the MVC design pattern and worked through the challenges, it’s time to put it all together. As you work through this assignment we recommend that you refer to previous code and lessons. Many portions of this assignment should be familiar. If you find yourself thinking that a method looks very similar, albeit with a different name, that’s a good thing!

Due to the complex nature of this project the requirements from time to time may seem to be a set of instructions. This is intentional as a way to hopefully limit frustration. If you would like to attempt this without any hints please read the brief below instead of the requirements. 

The instructions will be detailed at first but if a similiar problem reappears later in the assignment, expect the instructions to be shortened. For example when setting up a delegate for the first time we will be warned that a property named delegate is required. The second time we won’t warn you! 

When approaching this project, we STRONGLY recommend working on one part at a time.  As such, we have broken this assignment into multiple parts.

The solutions provided are not the only way to complete this assignment. You are highly encouraged to customize your application and attempt the problems on your own before viewing the solution videos. If your application meets the specified requirements, then you have solved that problem.  What is offered is concise and clean code that may prove to be a helpful comparison as you work through the assignment. 

As a final nudge in the right direction, watch the storyboard setup videos if you are unsure where to start after reading the requirements. The project requirements follow the solution videos so if you get stuck just watch the related solution video. You can also use the solutions videos to confirm you have correctly completed a requirement. It's good practice to check your code often and make sure we detect bugs early on.
